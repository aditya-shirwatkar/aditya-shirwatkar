I am a sophomore undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering at [Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur](http://vnit.ac.in/), who is an aspiring robotics researcher and wishes to make the world a better place through the advancements in robotics and AI :innocent: .

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [**Trajectory Optimization (focused on Bipedal Systems)**](https://github.com/IvLabs/biped_trajectory_optimization) and implementing few [**Optimal Control algorithms**](https://github.com/aditya-shirwatkar/UnderactuatedRobotics) on Underactuated Systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking forward to researching various ways to integrate **Optimal Controls** with new advancements in **Reinforcement Learning**.
