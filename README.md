**More About Me**:

- :rocket: My current research interests lie in developing optimal control algorithms for highly dynamic and agile locomotions of legged robots in challenging environments.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Trajectory Optimization (focused on Bipedal Systems)](https://github.com/IvLabs/biped_trajectory_optimization) and implementing few [Optimal Control algorithms](https://github.com/aditya-shirwatkar/UnderactuatedRobotics) on Underactuated Systems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also looking forward to researching various ways to integrate **Optimal Controls** with new advancements in **Reinforcement Learning**
- ðŸ’¬ I am happy to share my experiences in robotics and would like to hear about yours too
- âš¡ Check out some of the projects of our growing community that I'm part of at - [**IvLabs**](https://www.ivlabs.in/)
